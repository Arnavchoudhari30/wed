The test cases for GitHub cover the core functionalities of the platform, ensuring that users can perform essential operations like logging in, managing repositories, and collaborating through issues. These test scenarios validate both positive and negative user flows, such as successful login with valid credentials and appropriate error handling for invalid login attempts. By verifying functionalities like repository creation, issue tracking, forking, and cloning, these cases ensure the platform remains stable and user-friendly under typical usage patterns.

Each test case is designed with clear steps and expected outcomes to maintain consistency and thoroughness during testing. Priority levels are assigned to help identify critical workflows that impact user experience the most, such as login and repository management. Testing GitHub in this structured manner helps maintain a high-quality development environment, supports seamless collaboration among developers, and ensures that key features perform as expected across web and command-line interfaces.
